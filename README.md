## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project analysed Airbnb's Seattle data in 2016, to answer below questions:

> 1. Can you build a price suggestor for listings? which features impact the price most?<br>
> 2. What are the attributes of listings with higher review scores? <br>
> 3. How the price changes over one year?<br>
> 4. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle?<br>



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

**Detailed work including codes and analysis is in [*this notebook*](https://github.com/BambooPalace/Case-Study-Airbnb-Seattle-Data/blob/master/Airbnb%20Dataset%20Analysis-V2.ipynb), following CRISP-DM procedure.** <br>

The <a href='https://github.com/BambooPalace/UdacityDataScienceNanoDegree/tree/master/seattle%20airbnb%20dataset'>
    datasets</a> are provided by Airbnb through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data), as below:<br>
- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day
Some tips from Udacity's data science course are also included <a href='https://github.com/BambooPalace/UdacityDataScienceNanoDegree/tree/master/Course2-Intro%20to%20DataScience'> here</a> in the same repository. 
        


## Project intepretation<a name="results"></a>

In this [<b>Medium blog</b>](https://medium.com/@aprilgng/airbnb-seattle-dataset-analysis-263a05e7fad) I summarized and shared interesting insights about Seattle.
Here is a peak of them:
> 1. The number of bedrooms and number of people to the listing can accomodate are the top price indicators.
> 2. listings reviews hugely depend on how the hosts behave.
> 3. Seattle listings are the most expensive in July, so cross that month in your trip planner!
> 4. July is not Seattle's most visited time though, it's August! But apparently vistors to Capitol hill think differently, if you know why, comment in my blog okay?

The thought process on data and feature handling in my project are original, but praise Stackoverflow for the times when I have problems in coding.
